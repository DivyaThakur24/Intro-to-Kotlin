# Intro-to-Kotlin
An introductory workshop into Kotlin development

The slides provide a small overview of the language and why it's useful for Android developers.

The excercises are meant to be used with the EduTools Plugin for IntelliJ & Android Studio

# Expected Flow
1. Go Through Slides Until `Hello Kotlin`
2. Transition to the exercises and work through basic syntax
3. Finish with slides for additional resources

# Setup Video
Setup instructions are included in the repo, but I've also created a short video to walkthrough the setup process.
